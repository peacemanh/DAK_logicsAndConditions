# Repository Management Guide

### Cloning the Repository
### To clone the repository for the first time, use the following command:
git clone https://github.com/peacemanh/DAK_logicsAndConditions.git
### This will create a local copy of the repository on your machine.

### Keeping Your Local Code Up-to-Date
### To ensure your local code is up-to-date with the latest changes from the main branch, run the following command:
git pull origin main
### This command fetches and merges updates from the remote repository into your local branch.

### Pushing Changes to the Remote Repository
### After making changes to your local code, you need to push these changes to the remote repository. You can do this in two ways:

## 1. Using Git Command Line
### To push your changes using the Git command line, follow these steps:

### Stage Your Changes:
git add <filename>

### Commit Your Changes:
git commit -m "Your commit message"

### Push Your Changes:
git push origin main

## 2. Using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) UI
### To push changes using the VS Code UI, follow these steps:

### Open the Source Control Panel:
### Click on the Source Control icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the VS Code window.

### Stage Your Changes:
### You will see a list of changed files. Click the + icon next to each file to stage it,
### or click the + icon at the top of the panel to stage all changes.

### Commit Your Changes:
### In the Source Control panel, enter a commit message in the input box at the top.
### Click the checkmark icon (âœ”) or press Ctrl+Enter (or Cmd+Enter on macOS) to commit your changes.

### Push Your Changes:
### After committing, click on the ... (More Actions) icon in the Source Control panel.
### Select Push from the dropdown menu.
### Alternatively, you can use the Sync Changes button (ðŸ”„) if it is available in the status bar to both push and pull changes.
